Gather pertinent information, _e.g._, alarms, events, data, assumptions, intuitions (**observe**).\\r\\n1. Consider impact categories, below (**orient**), and determine if there is a possible incident (**decide**):\\r\\n1. Initiate a response if there is an incident (**act**). If in doubt, initiate a response. The incident commander and response team can adjust upon investigation and review.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Assess Functional Impact\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the direct or likely impact on your mission? (_e.g._, business operations, employees, customers, users)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Mission/business degradation or failure: **incident!**\\r\\n- None: assess information impact.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Assess Information Impact\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the direct or likely impact on your information/data, particularly anything sensitive?

How can we improve future detection and investigation?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUse the following as a starting point for detective remediation:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Enhance logging and retention for system logs, particularly critical systems.\\r\\n- Enhance logging for applications, including SaaS applications.\\r\\n- Enhance log aggregation.\\r\\n- Update network and host IDS signatures using IOCs.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Contain\\r\\n\\r\\n> \"How can we stop this from spreading, or getting more severe? How can we improve future containment?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUse the following as a starting point for containment remediation:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Implement access lists (ACLs) at network segment boundaries\\r\\n- Implement blocks at the enterprise boundary, at multiple layers of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).\\r\\n- Disable or remove compromised account access.\\r\\n- Block malicious IP addresses or networks.\\r\\n- Black hole or sinkhole malicious domains.\\r\\n- Update network and host IPS and anti-malware signatures using IOCs.\\r\\n- Remove critical or compromised systems from the network.\\r\\n- Contact providers for assistance (_e.g._, internet service providers, SaaS vendors)\\r\\n- Whitelist network connections for critical servers and services.\\r\\n- Kill or disable processes or services.\\r\\n- Block or remove access for external vendors and partners, especially privileged access.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Eradicate\\r\\n\\r\\n> \"How can we eliminate this from our assets? How can we improve future eradication?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUse the following as a starting point for eradication remediation:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Rebuild or restore compromised systems and data from known-good state.\\r\\n- Reset account passwords.\\r\\n- Remove hostile accounts or credentials.\\r\\n- Delete or remove specific malware (difficult!).\\r\\n- Implement alternative vendors.\\r\\n- Activate and migrate to alternate locations, services, or servers.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Choose Remediation Timing\\r\\n\\r\\nDetermine the timing strategy---when remediation actions will be taken---by engaging the Incident Commander, the system SMEs and owners, business unit SMEs and owners, and the executive team. Each strategy is appropriate under different circumstances:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Choose **immediate** remediation when it is more important to immediately stop attacker activities than to continue investigating. For example, ongoing financial loss, or ongoing mission failure, active data loss, or prevention of an imminent significant threat.\\r\\n- Choose **delayed** remediation when it is important to complete the investigation, or important not to alert the attacker. For example, long-term compromise by an advanced attacker, corporate espionage, or large-scale compromise of an an unknown number of systems.\\r\\n- Choose **combined** remediation when both immediate and delayed circumstances apply in the same incident. For example, immediate segmentation of a sensitive server or network to meet regulatory requirements while still investigating a long-term compromise.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Execute Remediation\\r\\n\\r\\n- Assess and explain risks of remediation actions to stakeholders. `TODO: Customize remediation risk approval procedure, if necessary.`\\r\\n- Immediately implement those remediation actions with little or no affect on the attacker (sometimes called \"posturing actions\"). For example, many of the [protection](#protect) and [detection](#detect) actions above are good candidates.\\r\\n- Schedule and task remediation actions according to the timing strategy.\\r\\n- Execute remediation actions in batches, as events, for maximum effectiveness and minimum risk.\\r\\n- Document execution status and time in the incident file, especially for temporary measures.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Iterate Remediation\\r\\n\\r\\n[Update the remediation plan](#update-remediation-plan) and repeat until closure.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Communicate\\r\\n\\r\\n**[Investigate](#investigate), [remediate](#remediate), and [communicate](#communicate) in parallel, using separate teams, if possible.** The Incident Commander will coordinate these activities.

Do not communicate speculation.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Communicate Internally\\r\\n\\r\\n### Notify and Update Stakeholders\\r\\n\\r\\n- Communicate with stakeholders as part of the initial and update calls, as well as via event-driven updates on the call and chat.\\r\\n- Coordinate independent updates (_e.g._, executive, legal) as required, but as infrequently as practicable, to keep the focus on investigation and remediation.\\r\\n- Focus on the best assessment of the vector, impact, summary, and highlights of the timeline including remediation steps. Do not speculate.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Notify and Update Organization\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Do not** notify or update non-response personnel until cleared by the Incident Commander, particularly if there is a risk of an insider threat.\\r\\n- Coordinate updates for teams or the entire organization with executives and business leadership.\\r\\n- Focus on the best assessment of the vector, impact, summary, and highlights of the timeline including remediation steps.

Focus on facts.\\r\\n- Be honest, accept responsibility, and present the facts, along with the plan to prevent similar incidents in future.\\r\\n- Be as detailed as possible with the timeline.\\r\\n- Be as detailed as possible in what information was compromised, and how it affects customers. If we were storing something we shouldn\\'t have been, be honest about it.

Find any related messages. Check:\\r\\n      - graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for the malware itself\\r\\n      - text or html files, sometimes opened automatically after encryption\\r\\n      - image files, often as wallpaper on infected systems\\r\\n      - contact emails in encrypted file extensions\\r\\n      - pop-ups after trying to open an encrypted file\\r\\n      - voice messages\\r\\n   1. Analyze the messages looking for clues to the ransomware type:\\r\\n      - ransomware name\\r\\n      - language, structure, phrases, artwork\\r\\n      - contact email\\r\\n      - format of the user id\\r\\n      - ransom demand specifics (_e.g._, digital currency, gift cards)\\r\\n      - payment address in case of digital currency\\r\\n      - support chat or support page\\r\\n   1. Analyze affected and/or new files. Check:\\r\\n      - file renaming scheme of encrypted files including extension (_e.g._, `.crypt`, `.cry`, `.locked`) and base name\\r\\n      - file corruption vs encryption\\r\\n      - targeted file types and locations\\r\\n      - owning user/group of affected files\\r\\n      - icon for encrypted files\\r\\n      - file markers\\r\\n      - existence of file listings, key files or other data files\\r\\n   1. Analyze affected software or system types. Some ransomware variants only affect certain tools (_e.g._, [databases](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mongodb-apocalypse-professional-ransomware-group-gets-involved-infections-reach-28k-servers/)) or platforms (_e.g._, [NAS products](https://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=88716))\\r\\n   1. Upload indicators to automated categorization services like [Crypto Sheriff](https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.php), [ID Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/), or similar.\\r\\n1. **Determine the scope:**\\r\\n   1. Which systems are affected? `TODO: Specify tool(s) and procedure`\\r\\n      - Scan for concrete indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as files/hashes, processes, network connections, etc. Use [endpoint protection/EDR](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [endpoint telemetry](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [system logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), etc.\\r\\n      - Check similar systems for infection (_e.g._, similar users, groups, data, tools, department,configuration, patch status): check [IAM tools](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [permissions management tools](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [directory services](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), _etc._\\r\\n      - Find external command and control (C2), if present, and find other systems connecting to it: check [firewall or IDS logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [system logs/EDR](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [DNS logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), [netflow or router logs](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource), _etc._\\r\\n   1. What data is affected? (_e.g._, file types, department or group, affected software) `TODO: Specify tool(s) and procedure`\\r\\n      - Find anomalous changes to file metadata such as mass changes to creation or modification times. Check [file metadata search tools](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource)\\r\\n      - Find changes to normally-stable or critical data files. Check [file integrity monitoring](#TODO-link-to-actual-resource) tools\\r\\n1. **Assess the impact** to prioritize and motivate resources\\r\\n   1. Assess functional impact: impact to business or mission.\\r\\n      - How much money is lost or at risk?\\r\\n      - How many (and which) missions are degraded or at risk?\\r\\n   1. Assess information impact: impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.\\r\\n      - How critical is the data to the business/mission?\\r\\n      - How sensitive is the data? (_e.g._, trade secrets)\\r\\n      - What is the regulatory status of data (_e.g._, PII, PHI)\\r\\n1. **Find the infection vector.** Check the tactics captured in the [Initial Access tactic](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001/) of MITRE ATT&CK[<sup>[4]</sup>](#ransomware-playbook-ref-4).

Read about how we handle [complex incidents](/before/complex_incidents.md) for more information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a **flexible structure**: every role will not be filled by a different person for every incident. For example, in a small incident the Deputy might act as the Scribe and Internal Liaison. The structure is flexible and scales based on the incident.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Wartime vs. Peacetime\\r\\n\\r\\nOn incident response calls (\"wartime\"), a different organizational structure overrides normal operations (\"peacetime\"):\\r\\n\\r\\n- The Incident Commander is in charge. No matter their rank during peacetime, they are now the highest ranked individual on the call, higher than the CEO.\\r\\n- Primary responders (folks acting as primary on-call for a team/service) are the highest ranked individuals for that service.\\r\\n- Decisions will be made by the IC after consideration of the information presented. Once that decision is made, it is final.\\r\\n- Riskier decisions can be made by the IC than would normally be considered during peacetime.\\r\\n- The IC may go against a consensus decision. If a poll is done, and 9/10 people agree but 1 disagrees. The IC may choose the disagreement option despite a majority vote. Even if you disagree, the IC\\'s decision is final. During the call is not the time to argue with them.\\r\\n- The IC may use language or behave in a way you find rude. This is wartime, and they need to do whatever it takes to resolve the situation, so sometimes rudeness occurs. This is not personal, and something you should be prepared to experience if you\\'ve never been in a wartime situation before.\\r\\n- You may be asked to leave the call by the IC, or you may even be forcibly kicked off a call. It is at the IC\\'s discretion to do this if they feel you are not providing useful input. Again, this is not personal and you should remember that wartime is different than peacetime.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Role: All Participants\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nAll participants in an incident response have the responsibility to help resolve the incident according to the incident response plan, under the authority of the Incident Commander.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Duties\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Exhibit Call Etiquette\\r\\n\\r\\n- Join both the call and chat.\\r\\n- Keep background noise to a minimum.\\r\\n- Keep your microphone muted until you have something to say.\\r\\n- Identify yourself when you join the call; State your name and role (_e.g._, \"I am the SME for team x\").\\r\\n- Speak up and speak clearly.\\r\\n- Be direct and factual.\\r\\n- Keep conversations/discussions short and to the point.\\r\\n- Bring any concerns to the Incident Commander (IC) on the call.\\r\\n- Respect time constraints given by the Incident Commander.\\r\\n- If you join only one channel (call or chat), do not actively participate, as it causes disjoined communication.\\r\\n- **Use clear terminology, and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. Clarity and accuracy is more important than brevity.**\\r\\n\\r\\n##### Reference: Common Voice Procedure\\r\\n\\r\\nStandard radio [voice procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure#Words_in_voice_procedure) **is not required**, however you may hear certain terms (or need to use them yourself). Common phrases include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Ack/Rog:** \"I have received and understood\"\\r\\n- **Say Again:** \"Repeat your last message\"\\r\\n- **Standby:** \"Please wait a moment for the next response\"\\r\\n- **Wilco:** \"Will comply\"\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do not** invent new abbreviations; favor being explicit over implicit.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Follow the Incident Commander\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Incident Commander (IC) is the leader of the incident response process.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Follow instructions from the incident commander.\\r\\n- Do not perform any actions unless the incident commander has told you to do so.\\r\\n- The commander will typically poll for strong objections before tasking a large action. Raise objections if you have them.\\r\\n- Once the commander has made a decision, follow that decision (even if you disagreed).\\r\\n- Answer any questions the commander asks you in a clear and concise way. Answering \"I don\\'t know\" is acceptable. Do not guess.\\r\\n- The commander may ask you to investigate something and get back to them in X minutes. Be ready with an answer within that time. Asking for more time is acceptable, but provide the commander an estimate.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Training\\r\\n\\r\\nRead and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Role: Incident Commander (IC)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Incident Commander (IC) acts as the single source of truth of what is currently happening and what is going to happen during an major incident. The IC is the highest ranking individual on any incident call, regardless of their day-to-day rank. They are the decision maker during an incident; they delegate tasks and listen to subject matter experts to resolve the incident. Their decisions made as commander are final.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour job as an IC is to evaluate the situation, provide clear guidance and coordination, recruiting others to gather context/details. **Do not perform any investigation or remediation:** delegate these tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Duties\\r\\n\\r\\nResolve the incident as quickly and as safely as possible using the incident response plan as a framework: lead the team to investigate, remediate, communicate. Use the Deputy to assist you, and delegate to relevant liaisons and experts (SMEs) at your discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Help prepare for incidents,\\r\\n   - Setup communications channels for incidents.\\r\\n   - Funnel people to these communications channels when there is a major incident.\\r\\n   - Train team members on how to communicate during incidents and train other Incident Commanders.\\r\\n1. Drive incidents to resolution,\\r\\n   - Get everyone on the same communication channel.\\r\\n   - Collect information from team members for their services/area of ownership status.\\r\\n   - Collect proposed repair actions, then recommend repair actions to be taken.\\r\\n   - Delegate all repair actions, the Incident Commander is NOT a resolver.\\r\\n   - Be the single authority on system status\\r\\n1. Facilitate calls and meetings,\\r\\n   - Gain consensus (Poll During a Decision)\\r\\n   - Provide status updates\\r\\n   - Reduce scope (dismiss attendees when possible)\\r\\n   - Spin off sub-teams\\r\\n   - Transfer command when necessary\\r\\n   - Sign off calls\\r\\n   - Maintain order\\r\\n   - Get straight answers\\r\\n   - Handle executive swoop such as\\r\\n     - Overriding the Incident Commander\\r\\n     - Anti-motivation\\r\\n     - Information requests\\r\\n     - Questioning severity\\r\\n   - Handle disruptive or belligerent responders\\r\\n1. Post Mortem,\\r\\n   - Creating the initial template right after the incident so people can put in their thoughts while fresh.\\r\\n   - Assigning the post-mortem after the event is over, this can be done after the call.\\r\\n   - Work with Team Leads/Managers on scheduling preventive actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Incident Commander uses some additional call procedures and lingo:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Always announce when you join the call if you are the on-call IC.\\r\\n- **Do not** let discussions get out of hand. Keep conversations short.\\r\\n- Note objections from others, but your call is final.\\r\\n- If anyone is being actively disruptive to your call, kick them off.\\r\\n- Announce the end of the call.\\r\\n- After an incident, communicate with other training Incident Commanders on any debrief actions you feel are necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Use clear terminology, and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. Clarity and accuracy is more important than brevity.**\\r\\n\\r\\n### Training\\r\\n\\r\\n- Read the incident response plan, including all roles and playbooks.\\r\\n- Participate in an incident response exercise.\\r\\n- Shadow a current incident commander without actively participating, keeping your questions until the end.\\r\\n- Reverse shadow a current incident commander. Respond to incidents with the current IC there to take over if necessary.\\r\\n- _OPTIONAL:_ facilitation training\\r\\n- _OPTIONAL:_ Refer to [Incident Responders as Facilitators (and Therapists)](#FIX) and the [PagerDuty Incident Commander training](https://response.pagerduty.com/training/incident_commander/) for more ideas and discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Prerequisites\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no seniority or business-unit prerequisites to become an Incident Commander, it is a role open to anyone with the training and ability. Before you can be an Incident Commander, it is expected that you meet the following criteria:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Excellent verbal and written **communication skills**.\\r\\n- **High-level knowledge** of business infrastructure and functions.\\r\\n- Excellent critical thinking, judgment, and decision-making.\\r\\n- Flexibility and ability to **listen to expert feedback**, modifying plans as necessary.\\r\\n- **Participated in at least two incident responses**.\\r\\n- Gravitas, ability to **take command**, and **willingness to kick people off a call** to remove distractions, even if it\\'s the CEO.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeep technical knowledge is not required! Incident Commanders do not require deep technical knowledge of our systems. Your job as Incident Commander is to coordinate the response, not make technical changes. Don\\u2019t think you can\\u2019t be an Incident Commander just because you\\u2019re not in the engineering department.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Graduation\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon completion of training, add yourself to the Incident Commander roster.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Role: Deputy Incident Commander (Deputy)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nA Deputy Incident Commander (Deputy) is a direct support role for the Incident Commander (IC). The Deputy enables the IC to focus on the problem at hand, rather than worrying about documenting steps or monitoring timers. The deputy supports the IC and keeps them focused on the incident. As a Deputy, you will be expected to take over command from the IC if they request it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Duties\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Bring up issues to the Incident Commander that may otherwise not be addressed (keeping an eye on timers that have been started, circling back around to missed items from a roll call, etc).\\r\\n1. Be a \"hot standby\" Incident Commander, should the primary need to either transition to a SME, or otherwise have to step away from the IC role.\\r\\n1. Manage the incident call, and be prepared to remove people from the call if instructed by the Incident Commander.\\r\\n1. Monitor the status of the incident, and notify the IC if/when the incident escalates in severity level.\\r\\n1. Monitor timers:\\r\\n   - track how long the incident has been running\\r\\n   - notify the IC every X minutes so they can take actions (_e.g._, \"IC, be advised the incident is now at the 10 minute mark.\")\\r\\n1. Monitor task deadlines (e.g., \"IC, be advised the timer for [TEAM]\\'s investigation is up.\")\\r\\n\\r\\n### Training\\r\\n\\r\\n- Read and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Prerequisites\\r\\n\\r\\n- Be trained as an [Incident Commander](#role-incident-commander-ic).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Role: Scribe\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nA Scribe documents the timeline of an incident as it progresses, and makes sure all important decisions and data are captured for later review. The Scribe should focus on the incident file, as well as follow-up items for later action.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Duties\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Ensure the incident call is being recorded.\\r\\n1. Note in chat and in the file timelines: important data, events, and actions, as they happen. Specifically:\\r\\n   - Key actions as they are taken\\r\\n   - Status reports when one is provided by the IC\\r\\n   - Any key call-outs either during the call or at the ending review\\r\\n1. Update the chat with who the IC is, who the Deputy is, and that you\\'re the scribe (if not already done).\\r\\n\\r\\nScribing is more art than science. The objective is to keep an accurate record of important events that occurred, Use your judgement and experience. But here are some general things you most definitely want to capture as scribe.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The result of any polling decisions.\\r\\n- Any followup items that are called out as \"We should do this..\", \"Why didn\\'t this?..\", etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Training\\r\\n\\r\\nRead and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Prerequisites\\r\\n\\r\\n- Excellent verbal and written **communication skills**.\\r\\n- Anyone can act as a scribe during an incident, and are chosen by the Incident Commander at the start of the call.\\r\\n- Typically the Deputy will act as the Scribe\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Training Process\\r\\n\\r\\n- Read the incident response plan, including all roles and playbooks.\\r\\n- _OPTIONAL:_ Parallel the actions of a scribe during an incident or exercise, and seek feedback from the actual Scribe and Incident Commander.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Role: Subject Matter Expert (SME)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nA Subject Matter Expert (SME) is a domain expert or designated owner of a team, component, or service (an \"area\"). You are there to support the incident commander in identifying the cause of the incident, suggesting and evaluation investigation, remediation, and communication actions, and following through on them as tasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Duties\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Diagnose common problems within your area of expertise.\\r\\n1. Rapidly fix issues found during an incident.\\r\\n1. Concise communication:\\r\\n   - Condition: What is the current state of your area? Is it healthy or not?\\r\\n   - Actions: What actions need to be taken if your area is not in a healthy state?\\r\\n   - Needs: What support do you need need to perform an action?\\r\\n1. Participate in the investigation, remediation, and/or communication phases of the response.\\r\\n1. Announce all suggestions to the incident commander, it is their decision on how to proceed, do not follow any actions unless told to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are on-call for any team, you may be paged for an incident and will be expected to respond as a subject matter expert (SME) for your team, component, or service. Anyone who is considered a \"domain expert\" can act as a SME for an incident. Typically the team\\'s primary on-call will act as the SME for that team.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Prepare for On-Call Period\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Be prepared, by having already familiarized yourself with our incident response policies and procedures.\\r\\n1. Make sure you have set up your alerting methods in accordance with our on-call procedure.\\r\\n1. Check you can join the incident call. You may need to install a browser plugin.\\r\\n1. Be aware of your upcoming on-call time and arrange swaps around travel, vacations, appointments, etc.\\r\\n1. If you are an Incident Commander, make sure you are not on-call for your team at the same time as being on-call as Incident Commander.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### During On-Call Period\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Have your laptop and Internet with you at all times during your on-call period (office, home, a MiFi, a phone with a tethering plan, etc).\\r\\n1. If you have important appointments, you need to get someone else on your team to cover that time slot in advance.\\r\\n1. When you receive an alert for an incident, you are expected to join the incident call and chat as quickly as possible (within minutes).\\r\\n1. You will be asked questions or given actions by the Incident Commander. Answer questions concisely, and follow all actions given (even if you disagree with them).\\r\\n1. If you\\'re not sure about something, bring in other SMEs from your team that can help. **Never hesitate to escalate**, if necessary.\\r\\n1. Do not blame. This incident response process is completely blameless: blaming is counter productive and distracts from the problem at hand. After-action review will identify places we can all improve.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Training\\r\\n\\r\\n- Read and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Role: Liaison\\r\\n\\r\\n### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nLiaisons interact with other teams or stakeholders, outside the incident response team. These often include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- External Liaison: responsible for interacting with customers, either directly, or via public communication.\\r\\n- Internal Liaison: responsible for interacting with internal stakeholders. Whether it\\'s notifying an internal team of the incident, or mobilizing additional responders within the organization.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Duties\\r\\n\\r\\n#### External or Customer Liaison\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Post any publicly facing messages regarding the incident (Twitter, etc).\\r\\n1. Notify the IC of any customers or media coverage reporting affects of the incident.\\r\\n1. Provide customers with the external message from the post-mortem once it is completed.\\r\\n1. Contact or interact with external stakeholders such as vendors, partners, law enforcement, _etc._\\r\\n1. **Do not** feel responsible for creating every message: work with the Incident Commander and other stakeholders.\\r\\n1. As appropriate, keep customers informed during an incident.\\r\\n1. Act as a voice for our customers to the Incident Commander, as this is useful for IC decision making.\\r\\n1. Gaining message approval after you have crafted the public message: copy the message into chat and wait for verbal/written confirmation from the IC before proceeding.\\r\\n\\r\\n##### Tips for Public Messages\\r\\n\\r\\n- Prepare a default message in advance that can be used for the initial update if the scope of the issue is unknown.\\r\\n- Be honest. Do not lie or guess.\\r\\n- Describe our progress in resolving the incident.\\r\\n  - _\"We are aware of an incident...\"_\\r\\n  - _\"We are investigating delayed notifications...\"_\\r\\n  - _\"A fix has been applied and is currently being deployed...\"_\\r\\n  - _\"The issue has been resolved...\"_\\r\\n- Be clear about how the incident is affecting customers. This is the primary piece of information customers will care about.\\r\\n- Provide workarounds customers can use until the incident is resolved.\\r\\n- Don\\'t estimate resolution times.\\r\\n- Provide the appropriate level of detail.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Internal Liaison\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Page SME\\'s or other on-call personnel as instructed by the Incident Commander.\\r\\n1. Notify or mobilize other teams within the organization (e.g. Finance, Legal, Marketing), as instructed by the Incident Commander.\\r\\n1. Track and anticipate SMEs on the call.\\r\\n1. Interact with stakeholders and provide status updates as necessary.\\r\\n1. Interact with internal stakeholders to answer their questions, to keep the primary call distraction free.\\r\\n1. Provide regular status updates to the executive team, giving an executive summary of the current status.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Training\\r\\n\\r\\nRead and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Prerequisites\\r\\n\\r\\n- Excellent verbal and written **communication skills**.\\r\\n- _OPTIONAL:_ Customer support training.\\r\\n- _OPTIONAL:_ Corporate communication or marketing training.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Conduct an After Action Review (AAR)\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Schedule an After Action Review (AAR) meeting within {{AAR_SLA}} and invite the attendees listed at {{AAR_ATTENDEES}}. Always include the following:\\r\\n   - The incident commander.\\r\\n   - Service owners involved in the incident.\\r\\n   - Key engineer(s)/responders involved in the incident.\\r\\n1. Designate an AAR owner who will investigate the incident in advance of the meeting to prepare, looking into the incident process itself including reviewing notes and reports.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conduct the AAR Meeting\\r\\n\\r\\nDocument answers to the following key questions:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **What happened?** Create a timeline, supported with data or other artifacts. **Avoid blame. Find facts.**\\r\\n1. **What was supposed to happen?**\\r\\n   - Detail deviations from process, procedure, or best practice, including SME assessments.\\r\\n   - Identify ways the incident could have been detected sooner, or responded to more effectively\\r\\n1. **What were the root causes?** Find root cause to things that happened and to things that should have happened.\\r\\n1. **How can we improve?** Capture action items _with assignees and due dates_. Consider:\\r\\n   - Stop: what should we stop doing?\\r\\n   - Start: what should we start doing?\\r\\n   - Continue: what should we keep doing?\\r\\n\\r\\n## Communicate AAR Status and Results\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AAR owner, in coordination with the Internal Liaison, will communicate the status of the AAR (see below)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Status Descriptions\\r\\n\\r\\n| Status        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\r\\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\r\\n| **Draft**     | AAR investigation is still ongoing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\\r\\n| **In Review** | AAR investigation has been completed, and is ready to be reviewed during the AAR meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                 |\\r\\n| **Reviewed**  | AAR meeting is over and the content has been reviewed and agreed upon.<br>If there are additional \"External Messages\", the communications team will take action to prepare.                                                                                               |\\r\\n| **Closed**    | No further actions are needed on the AAR (outstanding issues are tracked in tickets).<br>If no \"External Messages\", skip straight to this once the meeting is over.<br>If there are additional \"External Messages\", communications team will update AAR Closed once sent. |\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunicate the results of the AAR internally and finalize the AAR documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\n# About\\r\\n\\r\\nThis template was developed by the team at [Counteractive Security](https://www.counteractive.net), to help all organizations get a good start on a concise, directive, specific, flexible, and free incident response plan.
